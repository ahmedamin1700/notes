# file handling with examples

## CSV Module (Structured Data)

The `csv` module is essential for working with comma-separated values.

### The DictWriter/DictReader Pattern

This is better than the standard Reader/Writer because it treats each row as a
Python dictionary, making column access easier (`row['HeaderName']`).

#### Example: Reading (Parsing)

```python
# The critical step is converting types from string to native objects!
reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
for row in reader:
    row["Amount"] = float(row["Amount"]) # Convert string to float
    # ...
# The critical step is converting native types back to strings for the file!
writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
writer.writerow({
    "Date": expense["Date"].strftime("%Y-%m-%d"), # Convert date object to string
    # ...
})
```
